Ericsson Automotive Hackathon February 13 2016

A simple and basic implementation of an application that provides the framework for the implementation 
of real-time statistics of simulated Vehicle(s) provided by Ericsson. The idea is to view a friends's vehicle statistics such as 
distance left to an agreed meeting point in real-time on a Google Map.

Currently, only two markers exist. The Home point or the meeting point and 1 vehicle. However, it is simple to add multiple vehicles 
or markers on the map.

Additionally, it is easy to implement what statistics you want to view such as distance, time, general car info 
using the Ericsson resources provided along with the Google API.
